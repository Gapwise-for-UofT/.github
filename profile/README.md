Gapwise turns a University of Toronto timetable into a model of the day around it: **what is next, how much usable time exists between classes, where a student can realistically go, when they need to leave, and how certain the underlying campus information is.**

Gapwise supports **UTM, UTSG, UTSC, and mixed-campus schedules**. The web campus explorer includes source-backed building identities and footprints for all three campuses. Reviewed pedestrian routing, entrances, campus places, the public API, and the currently published raw-data snapshot cover UTM; St. George and Scarborough locations remain in their own campus namespaces and are never plotted as UTM.

The original ACORN calendar is parsed locally. Timetable arithmetic, routing, travel time, gap budgets, destination feasibility, and leave-by calculations are deterministic rather than delegated to a language model.

**`gapwise` owns deterministic student-day semantics. `data` owns shared public University of Toronto campus facts. `docs` documents released contracts. `status` observes public services. `android` and `ios` adapt canonical behavior to their platforms. `ai` consumes bounded context; it does not become a second timetable or routing engine.**

## Engineering principles

| | Principle | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **01** | **Privacy first** | Collect, transmit, and retain less student information. Keep trust boundaries narrow and explicit. |
| **02** | **Deterministic core** | Schedules, routes, durations, feasibility, and leave-by timing must be reproducible. |
| **03** | **Canonical facts** | Shared campus information has one owner, with provenance and visible uncertainty. |
| **04** | **Local where practical** | Keep useful functionality available without unnecessary network dependencies. |
| **05** | **Interfaces consume truth** | Web, Android, iOS, APIs, and AI should not silently recreate domain behavior. |
| **06** | **Scope stays honest** | All-campus timetable support does not imply all-campus map or routing coverage. |
| **07** | **Useful over complicated** | Architecture exists to improve a student's day, not to make the diagram larger. |

## Contributing

Choose the repository that owns the behavior you want to change. Shared contribution, security, support, and pull-request guidance lives in this organization's [`.github`](https://github.com/Gapwise-for-UofT/.github) repository and is inherited by repositories that do not provide a more specific policy.

Campus facts and routing evidence belong in **[`data`](https://github.com/Gapwise-for-UofT/data)**. Product behavior belongs in **[`gapwise`](https://github.com/Gapwise-for-UofT/gapwise)**. Android-specific implementation belongs in **[`android`](https://github.com/Gapwise-for-UofT/android)**. iOS-specific implementation belongs in **[`ios`](https://github.com/Gapwise-for-UofT/ios)**. Public documentation belongs in **[`docs`](https://github.com/Gapwise-for-UofT/docs)**. Keep changes focused and preserve the source-of-truth boundary.
